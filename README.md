## Overview

This project is a learning project based on the TI Launchpad TM4C123GXL LaunchPad, focusing on the QPC framework and UCOS2 RTOS. 

- Source Code: Follows the embedded software layered architecture style.
- Build: GNU Makefile.
- Application: Typical CPS, closed-loop control system.

## Features

- **QPC Framework**: Utilizes the QP-C framework for state machine management.
- **UCOS2 RTOS**: Implements UCOS2 as the real-time operating system.
- **TM4C123GXL LaunchPad**: Designed for the TI Launchpad TM4C123GXL board.
- **GNU Makefile**: Provides a build system for compiling the project.
- **Control Algorithm**: Real-time control algorithm accumulation.
